Here is my final homework for EE369 in SJTU.  
I used Pytorch with python3.7 and the code can work well on Windows and Ubuntu.  

You can run **test.py** to get the final result in Leaderboard.  
The **test.py** will output a **submission.csv**, which is the final result in Leaderboard.  
Run **train.py** then you can train your own model.Results will be saved in **result** file. 
## Attention
You must put **test** and **train_val** in the same  in the same root directory as **test.py** and **train.py**.  
for instance:
